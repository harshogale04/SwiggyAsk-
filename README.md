# Swiggy Annual Report — RAG Question Answering System

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that answers natural language questions about Swiggy's Annual Report FY 2023-24.

All answers are grounded strictly in the source document — no hallucination.

## Tech Stack

- PyMuPDF — PDF text extraction  
- sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) — text embeddings  
- FAISS — vector similarity search  
- Gemini 1.5 Flash — answer generation  
- FastAPI — backend server  
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — frontend UI

# Setup and Running

## 1. Create and Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### Mac/Linux
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Windows
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 3. Configure Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
PDF_PATH=./data/swiggy_annual_report.pdf
INDEX_PATH=./data/faiss_index
EMBED_MODEL=all-MiniLM-L6-v2
TOP_K=5
```

## 4. Place the PDF

Download the Swiggy FY 2023-24 Annual Report and save it as:

```
data/swiggy_annual_report.pdf
```

---

## 5. Ingest the PDF (Run Once)

```bash
python ingest.py
```

This builds the FAISS index and saves it to `data/faiss_index/`.  
Only needs to run once.

---

## 6. Start the Server

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn index.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Open in browser:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

---

## OR Use Terminal Interface

```bash
python cli.py
```

---

# How It Works

1. The PDF is extracted page by page and split into overlapping text chunks  
2. Each chunk is converted into a vector using a sentence-transformer model  
3. All vectors are stored in a FAISS index on disk  
4. When a question is asked, it is also converted to a vector  
5. FAISS finds the top 5 most similar chunks from the document  
6. Those chunks are sent to Gemini with the question  
7. Gemini answers strictly from the provided chunks — no hallucination
